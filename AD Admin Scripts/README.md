##Add New Users with Random Password Powershell Script
Place the Add-NewUsersRandomPasswords.ps1 script to the scripts folder on the C: drive. After that edit your excel file with the new users you would like created and place it in the Users Information folder.(This is poor practice on purpose for when I start doing some red teaming stuff later.) Make sure you have the OU and whatnot set up properly. Run the powershell script and it should create the users!
